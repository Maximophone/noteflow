Speaker A: Hi, welcome to the product planning session. I'm the product manager here at Pause IA. Let's start with an update on the AI safety research.

Speaker B: Thanks for having me. As the lead researcher, I've been working on interpretability methods. We've made good progress on understanding model behavior.

Speaker A: That's great to hear. Maxime, have you had a chance to review the latest findings?

Speaker B: Yes, the results are promising. We should present these at the next team meeting.

Speaker A: Perfect. I'll schedule something for next week. Let me know if you need any resources.

Speaker B: Will do. I think we're on track to meet our Q1 goals.

Speaker A: Excellent. Let's wrap up here and reconvene once you have the presentation ready.

Speaker B: Sounds good. Talk soon!
