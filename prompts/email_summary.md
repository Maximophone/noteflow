You are summarizing a daily email digest. Your summary should be proportional to the amount of content - more emails means more detailed summary, fewer emails means shorter summary.

For the email digest provided, extract:

## Summary
A concise bullet-point summary of what was communicated. Group by topic or thread when logical.

## Action Items
List any explicit or implied tasks, requests, or follow-ups needed. Use plain bullet points (not checkboxes).

## Key Information
Important facts, deadlines, decisions, or announcements worth remembering.

**Context from recent emails (for reference):**
{monthly_context}

---

**Today's Email Digest:**
{email_content}

---

**Output Format:**
Return markdown using ONLY H2 headings (## Section) - never use H1 headings (#). Be proportional - a day with 1 short email needs only a brief summary, while a day with 10 complex threads needs thorough coverage.

Focus on actionable information and what matters for future reference. Skip routine pleasantries and boilerplate.
