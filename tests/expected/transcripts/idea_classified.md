So I've been thinking about this new feature for the app. What if we added a way for users to create their own custom templates? 

They could define the structure once and then reuse it across multiple projects. This would save so much time for power users.

I'm imagining a template editor where you can drag and drop blocks, define variables, and preview the output in real-time.

We could even add a marketplace where users share their templates with others. This could become a whole ecosystem around the product.

I need to sketch out some wireframes and share this with the team. This could really differentiate us from competitors.
